# About me

I am a junior undergraduate from **Computer Science, Zhejiang University** with an **honors minor** in Chu Kochen Honors College of Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education. 

My research interest mainly falls on **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**, especially generative model for image and music generation, like Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) and Energy Based Model (EBM). I also preserve an interest in cross-displinary areas, where Machine Leaning and Computer Vision can be applied and boost other subjects.

I am now a [**CSST**](https://csst.ucla.edu/) (Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology) student under Professor Yingnian Wuâ€™s supervision in VCLA at UCLA.

| <img src="/assets/img/deformable.png" style="zoom:20%" /> | **Generate Realistic Images while Disentangling of Appearance and Geometry**<br />Deformable Model aims at disentangling the appearance and geometric information of an image in an unsupervised fashion.<br />Here we hopes to keep the ability of disentangling network while making the output less blurry. *(Work in progress)* |
| <img src="/assets/img/Coop.png" style="zoom:20%" />       | **Research on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Energy Based Model**<br />This work is based on the [CoopNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09408).<br />We conduct experiments on Energy Based Model with MCMC sampling comparing Langevin Dynamics and Hamiltonian Dynamic. |
| <img src="/assets/img/CLAF.png" style="zoom:20%" />       | **"Mind Band" - the AI Music Composer**<br />We design a music generator based on GAN while viewing music pieces as piano rolls.<br />For some music samples, please follow this [link](http://ryf1123.github.io/personal/2019-08-11-music/).<br />[[code]](https://github.com/ryf1123/CLAF) |
