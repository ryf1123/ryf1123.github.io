# About me

I am a junior undergraduate from **Computer Science**, Zhejiang University with an **honors minor** in Chu Kochen Honors College of Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education. 

My research interest mainly falls on **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**, especially generative model for image and music generation, like GAN and EBM. I also preserve a long-last interest in cross-displinary areas (that why I am currently enroll in CSST), where Machine Leaning and Computer Vision can be applied and boost other subjects.

I am now a **[CSST](https://csst.ucla.edu/)** students (Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology) under Professor Yingnian Wu in [VCLA](https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) at UCLA.
