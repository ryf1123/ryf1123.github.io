# About me

I am a junior undergraduate from **Computer Science, Zhejiang University** with an **honors minor** in Chu Kochen Honors College of Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education. 

My research interest mainly falls on **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**, especially generative model for image and music generation, like GAN and EBM. I also preserve an interest in cross-displinary areas, where Machine Leaning and Computer Vision can be applied and boost other subjects.

I am now a [CSST](https://csst.ucla.edu/) (Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology) student under Professor Yingnian Wuâ€™s supervision in VCLA at UCLA.
