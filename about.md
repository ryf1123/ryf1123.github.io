Hello, I am Yufan Ren(任宇凡). I am currently an undergraduate of Computer Science in Zhejiang University, interested in and focusing on hybriding humanism and technology to maximize its benefits to the human society while preventing predictable and unpredictable problems that might be unbearable for today's and later generations. 

For personal life, I preserve a long lasting interest for serious movies and books (e.g.[《我与地坛》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Tiesheng)) for the mind travel during the period enjoying them. I also have a love for music pieces of [华晨宇](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWc6Yta51X4), Mayday(五月天) and Adele.

If you share the same belief or the same interests, maybe we should have a talk : )

One more thing: nice to see you today.
