# CLAF: Chord Learning and Adversarial Framework for Symbolic Polyphonic Music Generation 

## Audio Samples

### Selected audio with specific themes

Actually, it was found that in this model, output songs are fairly diversed and the quality of most songs are high (over 50% songs generated are regarded as high quality based on our Chord assessment model mentioned below). What we do in the so-called "selection" is just find representative songs of different themes.
