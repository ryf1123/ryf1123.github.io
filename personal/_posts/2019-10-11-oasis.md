## Oasis in the sky

"Oasis in the sky" is a WebGL-based CG first-person game, which aims at providing immersive experience of wandering on an island flying in the sky. 

To control, you can use familiar controling like "W-A-S-D" and mouse like any other first-person games. Also you can use other keys for more manipulation like jumping into and controling the Hot air balloon, change the weather (from sunny to rainning). It's quite interesting. 

Some of the models in this game is borrowed from the internet, like furnitures in the nice house. The main island is built in blender. 

Just go for fun in your web browser!
