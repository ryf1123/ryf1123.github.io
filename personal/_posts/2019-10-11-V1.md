# Learning vector representation of local content and matrix representation of local motion, with implications for V1

This paper proposes a representational model for image pair such as consecutivevideo frames that are related by local pixel displacements, in the hope that the modelmay shed light on motion perception in primary visual cortex (V1). The modelcouples the following two components. (1) The vector representations of localcontents of images. (2) The matrix representations of local pixel displacementscaused by the relative motions between the agent and the objects in the 3D scene.When the image frame undergoes changes due to local pixel displacements, thevectors are multiplied by the matrices that represent the local displacements. Ourexperiments show that our model can learn to infer local motions. Moreover, themodel can learn Gabor-like filter pairs of quadrature phases.

## Model

Learned results on V1Deform. (a) Learned units. Each block shows two learned units withinthe same sub-vector. (b) Fitted Gabor patterns. (c) Distributions of spatial-frequency bandwidth (inoctaves) and spatial phaseÏ†.

## Result

Examples of inference of displacement field on V1Deform. For each block, from left toright areIt,It+1, ground truth displacement field and inferred displacement field by pre-trainedFlowNet 2.0 model and our learned model respectively. The displacement fields are color coded.

## ResNet: implication beyond V1 

A ResNet-like post processing is added to refine the result.

## Conclusion

This paper proposes a simple representational model that couples vector representations of localimage contents and matrix representations of local motions. Unlike existing models for V1 that focuson statistical properties of natural images or videos, our model serves a direct purpose of perceptionof local motions caused by the relative motions between the agent and the 3D environment. Ourmodel learns Gabor-like units with quadrature phases. We also give biological interpretations of thelearned model and connect it to the spatiotemporal energy model. Our model is novel, and it is ourhope that it adds to our understanding of motion perception in V1 in terms of modeling and inference.
