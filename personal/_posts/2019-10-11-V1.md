## Learning vector representation of local content and matrix representation of local motion, with implications for V1

This paper proposes a representational model for image pair such as consecutivevideo frames that are related by local pixel displacements, in the hope that the modelmay shed light on motion perception in primary visual cortex (V1). The modelcouples the following two components. (1) The vector representations of localcontents of images. (2) The matrix representations of local pixel displacementscaused by the relative motions between the agent and the objects in the 3D scene.When the image frame undergoes changes due to local pixel displacements, thevectors are multiplied by the matrices that represent the local displacements. Ourexperiments show that our model can learn to infer local motions. Moreover, themodel can learn Gabor-like filter pairs of quadrature phases.
