> What impressed me the most and guided me to join the Morningside Cultural China Scholar Program was a question mentioned by Ms. Jing Xu, a student delegate of the program, in one of their seminars.

她说，他们去香港访问的时候，向Mr. Chandran Nair问了一个问题：”我们的同学凭借自己的努力，在高考中取得了优异的成绩。于是得到了相应的教育资源。我们为什么要帮助那些可能因为不够努力，在这个规则里面成为losser的人？“

The delegation asked a question to Mr. Chandran Nair, the founder of the Global  Institute for Tomorrow, during their visit to Hong Kong. “Many students like us got high scores in the National Entrance Examination through our own efforts and we correspondingly obtained the educational resources. But why should we help those people who became losers in this game probably because they were not hardworking enough?”

回答是”为什么你在一场考试中得到高分，或者智商比较高就理应得到便宜优质的教育资源呢？我们得到教育资源本身就隐含着一种社会期待，希望我们这些’更加聪明的人’能够反哺社会，创造一个更好的世界。“

Mr. Chandran Nair answered, "Why should you get cheap but high-quality educational resources only because of one exam or higher IQ? The educational resources we gained is implicitly a kind of social expectation, hoping those ‘clever guys’ like us can reciprocate the society and make a better world."
