Since column 0 has 1 and column 1 has 2, we can't directly place 3 or 4. Let's move to row 2. The missing number is 2. Since column 1 has 1, column 2 has 3, and column 3 has 4, we can place 2 in row 2, column 0. Now the grid is [['2', '4', '*', '1'], ['1', '2', '*', '*'], ['2', '1', '3', '4'], ['*', '*', '2', '1']].\\n\\nLet's move to row 3. The missing numbers are 3 and 4. Since column 2 has 2 and column 3 has 1, we can't directly place 3 or 4. Let's go back to row 0. The missing numbers are 2 and 3. Since column 0 has 2, we can place 3 in row 0, column 0, and 2 in row 0, column 2.

Since column 0 has 1, column 1 has 2, column 2 has 2, and column 3 has 1, we can place 4 in row 1, column 2, and 3 in row 1, column 3. Now the grid is [['3', '4', '2', '1'], ['1', '2', '4', '3'], ['2', '1', '3', '4'], ['*', '*', '2', '1']].\\n\\nLet's move to row 3. The missing numbers are 3 and 4. Since column 2 has 2 and column 3 has 1, we can place 4 in row 3, column 0, and 3 in row 3, column 1.
