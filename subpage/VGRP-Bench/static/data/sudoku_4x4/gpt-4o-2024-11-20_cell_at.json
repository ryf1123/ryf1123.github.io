Each 2x2 **block** must have the digits 1 through 4 without repetition.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n#### Analyzing Row 1:\n- Row 1 currently contains: **3, 1, 2**. \n- The missing digit in Row 1 is **4**.\n\n#### Analyzing Column 0:\n- Column 0 currently contains: **2, _, 1, 3**.\n- The missing digit in Column 0 is also **4**.\n\n#### Analyzing the Top-left Block:\n- The top-left block (positions (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)) currently contains: **2, _, 3**.\n- The missing digit in this block is **4**.\n\nAll constraints point to the missing digit **4**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of cell (1, 0) is **4**."

The only missing number for this column is **2**, because 4 is already repeated, and 2 is not yet placed.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with Block (Bottom Left)\nThe bottom left \\(2 \\times 2\\) block has {3, 4, _, _}.
