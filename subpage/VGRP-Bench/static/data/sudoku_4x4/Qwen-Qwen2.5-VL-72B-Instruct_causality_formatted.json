The grid is a 6x6 and is divided into 2x3 blocks. The numbers 1 and 2 have been placed in specific cells, and we need to make sure that each row, column, and block contains the numbers 1 through 6 exactly once. Let's start filling in the grid based on the given constraints.\n\n1. The second row already has a '1' in the fifth column, so the other '1' in that row must be placed in the first column. This means the first row cannot have a '1' in the first column.\n2. The third row already has a '2' in the third column, so the other '2' in that row must be placed in the first column. This means the first row cannot have a '2' in the first column.\n3. The fourth row already has a '2' in the first column, so the other '2' in that row must be placed in the fifth column. This means the fifth row cannot have a '2' in the fifth column.\n4. The sixth row already has a '1' in the fifth column, so the other '1' in that row must be placed in the first column. This means the fifth row cannot have a '1' in the first column.\n5. The first block (top-left 2x3) needs to have the numbers 1 through 6. Since the second row already has '1' and '2', the first row must have the remaining numbers.\n6. The second block (top-right 2x3) needs to have the numbers 1 through 6. Since the second row already has '1' and '2', the first row must have the remaining numbers.\n7. The third block (middle-left 2x3) needs to have the numbers 1 through 6. Since the third row already has '2', the fourth row must have the remaining numbers.\n8. The fourth block (middle-right 2x3) needs to have the numbers 1 through 6. Since the fourth row already has '2', the fifth row must have the remaining numbers.\n9. The fifth block (bottom-left 2x3) needs to have the numbers 1 through 6. Since the fourth row already has '2', the sixth row must have the remaining numbers.\n10. The sixth block (bottom-right 2x3) needs to have the numbers 1 through 6. Since the sixth row already has '1', the fifth row must have the remaining numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the rest of the grid.\", \"answer\": [[\"1\", \"3\", \"5\", \"4\", \"6\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"3\", \"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"6\", \"2\", \"5\", \"4\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"4\", \"1\", \"6\", \"3\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"1\", \"3\", \"2\", \"2\", \"6\"], [\"6\", \"2\", \"4\", \"1\", \"5\", \"3\"]]}\n```",

In the second row, a '1', '3', and '4' are missing. Since the last column needs a '1', remaining numbers need adjustment as per rules, middle cells should be filled with '3' in 2nd row giving row as [3, 1, 4, 2]. 3. The third row is missing '1', '3', and '4'. Per constraints of Sudoku, '3' must fill first column which leads to '1' for the second and '4' in last column: [2, 1, 3, 4]. 4. In the fourth row, '1', '2', and '3' are the missing numbers.

For simplicity, in this scenario, we're working with numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 given the 4x4 grid. Here's a step-by-step process for filling in the empty cells: 1) Analyze the first row containing '1', '*', '2', '*'. The missing numbers are 3 and 4. Considering the second and fourth columns, column 2 contains a 4 and column 4 contains a 1 in the third row. Therefore, the empty cells can be filled with 4 and 3, respectively. Given this, the first row is now complete: ['1', '4', '2', '3']. 2) Now consider the second row with  '*', '*', '*', '3'. The missing numbers to be accommodated here are 1, 2, and 4. Since the first column already contains a 1, the last column in the third and the fourth row contains a number, the only suitable position for 1 is the second row, first column; the number 2 can sit in the second position of the second row and number 4 in the third. Thus the second row is: ['1', '2', '4', '3']. 3) For the fourth row of '*', '1', '4', '2', there's only one missing number which is 3. Therefore, the completed grid looks like: ['3', '1', '4', '2'].
