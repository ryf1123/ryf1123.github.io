Identify rows, columns, and blocks where most numbers are filled and try to place the missing numbers in the most logical positions.\"\n\n1. In the first row (0th row), we have the numbers 4, 3, and 1. The only missing number is 2. The only empty slot left is at (0, 3). Hence, placing 2 in this position.\n\n2. Now the first row is filled: [4, 3, 1, 2].\n\n3. Move to the second row (1st row). We have 1, 4, and the empty slots. Placing 3 in the (1, 2) position fills that empty slot.\n\n4. The second row becomes [1, 0, 4, 3]. Now the missing numbers are in the empty slots at (1, 1) and (1, 0).\n\n5. Checking the constraints for the third row (2nd row) now; the numbers are 2, 3, and the unknowns at indices (2, 0) and (2, 3). The number 1 is missing and can only be placed in (2, 0) as it does not violate the row, column, or block conditions.\n\n6. Now the third row becomes [2, 3, 1, 0]. The missing numbers are at (3, 2) and (3, 1).\n\n7. We now focus on the second remaining row (3rd row) to place the numbers. It currently has numbers 3, 4, and the empty slots at (3, 0) and (3, 2). The number 1 must be placed in row 3 at index 2, filling the 3rd row as follows: [3, 4, 0, 1].\n\n8. Now checking column 0 and column 2. The final missing numbers are 2 for column 1 and 4 for column 3. This gives us the following grid:\n   \n   [4, 3, 1, 2]\n   [1, 0, 4, 3]\n   [2, 3, 1, 0]\n   [3, 2, 4, 1]\n\n9.

The grid is a 4x4 grid, which means it is divided into 4 blocks (each block is 2x2). We need to ensure that each row, column, and block contains unique numbers from 1 to 4.\n\n1. The first row already contains the numbers 3, _, _, _. We need to place the numbers 1, 2, 4 in the empty cells.\n2. The second row already contains the numbers 4, _, 2, 1.

The fourth row already contains the numbers _, 3, 1, 2. We need to place the numbers 3, _, 4, 1 in the empty cells.\n\nLet's start filling the grid step by step:\n\n- The second row block (2,1) and block (2,3) must contain 3 and a unique number from 1, 2, 4. Since (2,1) is already 4, the only possibility for (2,3) is 3. Now, (2,2) must be 1 (remaining numbers are 1 and 2 for (2,2)).\n- The third row block (3,1) and block (3,3) must contain 2 and a unique number from 1, 3, 4. Since (3,3) is already 3, the only possibility for (3,1) is 2. Now, (3,2) must be 4 (remaining numbers are 1 and 4 for (3,1)).\n- The fourth row block (4,1) and block (4,3) must contain 3 and a unique number from 1, 2, 4. Since (4,1) is already a new variable, let's place 4 in (4,3) because it can't be 3 and 2 (action safe).\n\nFilling the grid step by step using the logic above, we will get the following solution: \n\",\n\"answer\": \"[[_1, 4, _2, 3], [4, 1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 4, 3], [3, 3, 1, 2]]\"\n}\n```",

The grid is divided into 6 blocks, 3x2 each. Let's start by filling in the obvious numbers and and then use the elimination method for the remaining cells. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. In the top-left 2x2 block, we have digits '1', '3', and '4'. Therefore, we need a '2' and a '5-6' to fill the rest of the block. The cell in the bottom left corner (which is 0, 0) must be '2' because there's already a '3' in the same row and column.\n2. The second row from the top has '3' and '1'. We need a '2-4-5' in the remaining cells.\n3. The third row from the top has '3' and '4'. We need a '1-2-5-6'. The cell in the top left corner (which is 0, 1) must be '2' because there's already a '3' in the same row and column.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the rest of the grid:\n- In the first row, the only possibility for the top right cell (0, 7) is '2'.\n- In the second row, the cell in the bottom left (1, 0) must be '2' because there's already a '3' in the same row and column.\n- In the third row, the cell in the top left (2, 0) must be '2'.\n- In the fourth row, the only possibility for the top left cell (3, 0) is '2'.\n- In the fifth row, the cell in the bottom left (4, 0) must be '2' because there's already a '3' in the same row and column.\n- In the sixth row, the only possibility for the top right cell (5, 7) is '2'.\n\nAfter filling in the obvious numbers, we can see that the grid should be:\n[[2, 2, 2],\n [3, 5, 1],\n [2, 4, 3],\n [1, 6, 5],\n [2, 3, 4],\n [3, 6, 2]]\",\n\"answer\": [\n    [2, 2, 2],\n    [3, 5, 1],\n    [2, 4, 3],\n    [1, 6, 5],\n    [2, 3, 4],\n    [3, 6, 2]\n]\n}\n```",
