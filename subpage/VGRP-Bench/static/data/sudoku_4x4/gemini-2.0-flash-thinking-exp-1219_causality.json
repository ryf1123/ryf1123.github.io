So, cell (1,1) is 1 and cell (1,3) is 4.\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Missing numbers are 1, 2, 4.\n  - Cell (2,0) cannot be 3 because of column 0 and block 2.\n  - Cell (2,1) cannot be 3 because of block 2.\n  - Cell (2,2) cannot be 3 because of block 3.\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Missing numbers are 1 and 2.\n  - Cell (3,1) cannot be 3 because of block 2.\n\nLet's restart and try a different approach.\n\n- **Column 1:**\n  - Cannot be 1 because of row 1.\n- **Column 3:**\n  - Cannot be 3 because of row 2.\n\nLet's focus on Block 0:\n- Missing numbers are 1, 3, 4.\n\nLet's focus on Block 1:\n- Missing numbers are 1, 2, 4.\n\nLet's focus on Block 2:\n- Missing numbers are 1, 2, 4.\n\nLet's focus on Block 3:\n- Missing number is 1 or 2.\n\nLet's go cell by cell.\n- Cell (0,0): can be 1 or 4.\n- Cell (0,1): can be 1, 4.\n- Cell (0,2): can be 1, 2, 4.\n- Cell (0,3): can be 1, 2, 4.\n- Cell (1,1): can be 1, 4.\n- Cell (1,3): can be 1, 4.\n- Cell (2,0): can be 1, 2, 4.\n- Cell (2,1): can be 1, 2, 4.\n- Cell (2,2): can be 1, 2.\n- Cell (3,1): can be 1, 2.\n\nFrom Row 1, we know that the missing numbers are 1 and 4. Since column 2 has 3, cell (1,1) must be 1 and cell (1,3) must be 4.\n\n```\n* * * *\n2 1 3 4\n* * * 3\n3 * 4 *\n```\n\nNow let's look at column 0. Missing numbers are 1 and 4. Since row 0 is missing 1 and 4, cell (0,0) can be 4 and cell (2,0) can be 1.\n\n```\n4 * * *\n2 1 3 4\n1 * * 3\n3 * 4 *\n```\n\nNow let's look at row 0. Missing numbers are 1, 2, 3. Since column 2 has 3 and column 0 has 4, cell (0,2) can be 2 and cell (0,1) can be 3 and cell (0,3) can be 1.\n\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 1 3 4\n1 * * 3\n3 * 4 *\n```\n\nNow let's look at column 1. Missing numbers are 2, 4. Since row 3 has 4, cell (3,1) can be 2 and cell (2,1) can be 4.\n\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 1 3 4\n1 4 * 3\n3 2 4 *\n```\n\nNow let's look at row 2. Missing number is 2. So cell (2,2) is 2.\n\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 1 3 4\n1 4 2 3\n3 2 4 *\n```\n\nNow let's look at row 3. Missing number is 1.

So the remaining cells in this block can be 2 or 4.\n- In the second column, we have 1. So, the cell at Row 0, Col 1 cannot be 1.\n- In the fourth column, we have 2.

I need to fill in the missing numbers such that each row, each column, and each 2x2 block contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 without repetition.\\n\\nRow 0 is missing '1'.\\nRow 1 is missing '2' and '4'.\\nRow 2 is missing '1'.\\n\\nColumn 0 is missing '1'.\\nColumn 1 has all numbers.\\nColumn 2 is missing no numbers.\\nColumn 3 is missing '1' and '4'.\\n\\nBlock 0 (top-left) is missing '1'.\\nBlock 1 (top-right) is missing '1' and '4'.\\nBlock 2 (bottom-left) is missing '1'.\\nBlock 3 (bottom-right) is missing no numbers.\\n\\nLet's start by looking at Row 1. It's missing 2 and 4. In Block 1, the bottom right cell can't be 4 because there is a 4 in Row 3. So, the bottom right cell in Row 1 must be 2, and the top right cell in Row 1 must be 4.\\n\\nNow Row 1 is [3, 1, 4, 2].\\n\\nLooking at Column 3, it's missing 1 and 4. Since Row 1 has a 2 in the last column, the last cell in Column 3 cannot be 2. The top right cell in Row 0 can be 1.\\n\\nNow Row 0 is [4, 1, 2, 3].\\n\\nLooking at Column 0, it's missing 1. The missing cell is in Row 2.\\n\\nNow Row 2 is [1, 3, 4, 2].\\n\\nLooking at Column 3, it's missing 4. The missing cell is in Row 1.\\n\\nThe grid is now:\\n[[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n [3, 1, 4, 2],\\n [1, 3, 4, 2],\\n [2, 4, 1, 3]]\\n\\nThere's a mistake. Row 1 has two 1s. Let's backtrack.\\n\\nRow 1 is missing 2 and 4. In Block 1, the bottom right cell can't be 4 because there is a 4 in Row 3. So, the bottom right cell in Row 1 must be 2, and the top right cell in Row 1 must be 4.\\n\\nNow Row 1 is [3, 1, *, 2]. The missing number is 4.\\n\\nLooking at Column 3, it's missing 1 and 4. Since Row 1 has a 2 in the last column, the last cell in Column 3 cannot be 2. The top right cell in Row 0 can be 1 or 4. Let's look at Block 1. It's missing 1 and 4. The top right cell in Row 0 can be 1 or 4. The bottom right cell in Row 1 can be 2 or 4. Since Row 3 has a 3 in the last column, the top right cell in Row 0 cannot be 3. \\n\\nLet's look at Row 0. It's missing 1 and 4. In Block 0, the missing number is 1. So the top right cell in Row 0 is 1.\\n\\nNow Row 0 is [4, 1, 2, 3].\\n\\nLooking at Column 0, it's missing 1. The missing cell is in Row 2.\\n\\nNow Row 2 is [1, 3, 4, 2].\\n\\nLooking at Row 1, it's missing 4. The missing cell is in the last column.\\n\\nNow Row 1 is [3, 1, *, 4]. The missing number is 2.\\n\\nLooking at Row 2, it's missing 1. The missing cell is in the first column.\\n\\nThe grid is now:\\n[[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n [3, 1, *, 4],\\n [*, 3, 4, 2],\\n [2, 4, 1, 3]]\\n\\nRow 1 is missing 2. The missing cell is at index 2.\\nRow 2 is missing 1. The missing cell is at index 0.\\n\\nFinal check:\\nRow 0: 4, 1, 2, 3 (ok)\\nRow 1: 3, 1, 2, 4 (ok)\\nRow 2: 1, 3, 4, 2 (ok)\\nRow 3: 2, 4, 1, 3 (ok)\\nCol 0: 4, 3, 1, 2 (ok)\\nCol 1: 1, 1, 3, 4 (not ok)\\n\\nLet's restart the thought process.\\n\\nRow 0 is missing 1 and 4.\\nRow 1 is missing 2 and 4.\\nRow 2 is missing 1.\\n\\nColumn 0 is missing 1.\\nColumn 3 is missing 1 and 4.\\n\\nBlock 0 is missing 1.\\nBlock 1 is missing 1 and 4.\\nBlock 2 is missing 1.\\n\\nIn Row 0, the missing numbers are 1 and 4. In Block 0, the missing numbers are 1 and the number in row 1 col 2. The number in row 1 col 2 cannot be 1 because there is a 1 in column 1. So the number in row 1 col 2 must be 4. Then the missing number in Block 0 is 1, so the missing number in Row 0 is 1.\\n\\nRow 0: [4, 1, 2, 3]\\nRow 1: [3, 1, 4, 2]\\nRow 2: [1, 3, 4, 2]\\nRow 3: [2, 4, 1, 3]\\n\\nThis is incorrect. Row 1 has two 1s.\\n\\nLet's look at Row 1. Missing 2 and 4. The last cell in Row 1 cannot be 4 because there is a 4 in Row 3. So the last cell in Row 1 is 2. Then the third cell in Row 1 is 4.\\n\\nRow 1: [3, 1, 4, 2]\\n\\nLet's look at Row 0. Missing 1 and 4. The second cell cannot be 4 because there is a 4 in Row 1. So the second cell is 1. The last cell is 4.\\n\\nRow 0: [4, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\nLet's look at Row 2. Missing 1. The first cell is 1.\\n\\nRow 2: [1, 3, 4, 2]\\n\\nFinal check:\\nRow 0: 4, 1, 2, 3 (ok)\\nRow 1: 3, 1, 4, 2 (ok)\\nRow 2: 1, 3, 4, 2 (ok)\\nRow 3: 2, 4, 1, 3 (ok)\\nCol 0: 4, 3, 1, 2 (ok)\\nCol 1: 1, 1, 3, 4 (not ok)\\n\\nLet's try filling in the blanks based on blocks.\\nBlock 0: Missing 1. The missing cell is at [1, 2].\\nBlock 1: Missing 1 and 4. The missing cells are at [0, 1] and [1, 3].\\nBlock 2: Missing 1. The missing cell is at [2, 0].\\nBlock 3: Missing no numbers.\\n\\nIf [1, 2] is 1, then [0, 1] must be 4 and [1, 3] must be 4, which is not possible.\\nSo [1, 2] must be 4. Then Block 0 is missing 1 at [0, 1].\\n\\nGrid:\\n[[4, 1, 2, 3],\\n [3, 1, 4, *],\\n [*, 3, 4, 2],\\n [2, 4, 1, 3]]\\n\\nRow 1 is missing 2.

Row 1 and Row 2 have duplicate 2s.\\n\\nLet's go back to the original grid and try filling in based on rows and columns.\\nRow 0 is missing 1 and 4. Column 1 has a 1, so Row 0 Column 1 must be 4.

I will go through each row, column, and 2x2 block to identify the missing numbers and fill them in based on the Sudoku rules. \\n\\n- **Row 1:** Contains 2 and 4.

In Row 1, the missing numbers are 1 and 3. In Column 1, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. In Row 1, if column 1 is 1, then column 2 must be 3. Let's check if this is valid. If Row 1 is [2, 1, 3, 4], then column 1 has 2, 1, *, 3 and column 2 has *, *, 3, *. This seems possible. \\n\\nLet's look at Row 3. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 4. Column 1 already has 2 and 3. So, Row 0, Column 0 must be 1 or 4. \\n\\nConsider the bottom right block. It has 3 and 4. The missing numbers are 1 and 2. If Row 3, Column 2 is 1, then Row 3, Column 3 must be 2. If Row 3, Column 2 is 2, then Row 3, Column 3 must be 1.\\n\\nLet's try filling Row 0.

So the second cell in the second row can be 2 or 4.\nThe third column already has 1. So the third cell in the second row can be 3 or 4.\nThe fourth column already has 2 and 4. So the fourth cell in the second row can be 3.\nSo the second row is 1 _ _ 3.\nIn the first 2x2 block, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. Since the fourth cell is 3, the second cell must be 4 and the third cell must be 2.\n\n**Updated Grid:**\n```\n4 3 1 2\n1 4 2 3\n3 * 1 2\n2 1 * 4\n```\n\n**Step 3: Fill in the missing numbers in the third row.**\nThe third row has 3, 1, and 2.
