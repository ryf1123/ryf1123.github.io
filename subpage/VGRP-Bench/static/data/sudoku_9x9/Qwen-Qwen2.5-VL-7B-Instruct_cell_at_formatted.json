By examining the top-left block, which includes the cell at (0, 1), we can see that the numbers `6` and `8` are already present.

The empty cells in row 3 are positions 3, 5, and 6.\n   - **Column 1 (1st column)**: The numbers already present are 7 and 9. The empty cells in column 1 are positions 0, 2, 4, and 5.\n\n3. **Identify the Valid Numbers**:\n   - The numbers that can be placed in row 3 (positions 3, 5, and 6) are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 (since 7, 2, and 9 are already occupied).\n   - The numbers that can be placed in column 1 (positions 0, 2, 4, and 5) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 (since 7 and 9 are already occupied).\n\n4. **Check the Block Where (3, 1) Lies**:\n   - The 3,1 (10th cell) lies within the block that contains cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3).\n   - The numbers already present in this block are 7, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, and 1.\n   - The block does not have any 1s before placing 1 in (3,1).\n\nBased on the above analysis, the valid number that can be placed in cell (3, 1) is \\(1\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of the cell at (3, 1) is \\(1\\).",
