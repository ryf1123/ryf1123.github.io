We can start by focusing on the rows and columns and finding where these missing numbers can logically fit. For example, in the fourth row, there are no numbers in the cells. We can start by placing number 5, as it must appear once in all rows. Once we have a number in place, we can then look at the columns and blocks to place the remaining numbers. By the end of this process, we should have a completed Sudoku grid with all numbers from 1 to 9 in every cell with no repeated numbers in rows, columns, and blocks.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    [7, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5],\n    [8, 1, 4, 5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 7],\n    [2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 1, 9, 6, 8],\n    [5, 5, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 9, 7],\n    [9, 6, 3, 8, 1, 7, 5, 2, 4],\n    [4, 7, 2, 3, 8, 5, 1, 7, 9],\n    [5, 9, 6, 2, 7, 4, 7, 8, 1],\n    [2, 4, 1, 9, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7],\n    [3, 8, 7, 1, 5, 2, 9, 4, 6]\n  ]\n}\n```",
