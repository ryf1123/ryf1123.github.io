        "model_output": "To find the value of the cell at (7, 5) in the current Sudoku puzzle, we will check the existing numbers in the same row, column, and 3x3 block.\n\n1. **Row 7 (0-indexed)**: The numbers in this row are 5, 1, 5, 9. The unique numbers are {1, 5, 9}.\n2. **Column 5**: The numbers in this column are {1, 6, 4, 5, 8}. The unique numbers are {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}.\n3. **3x3 Block** (which contains cell (7, 5)): The block includes the numbers: 1, 5, 6, 4, and 5, which are {1, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- From Row 7: {1, 5, 9}\n- From Column 5: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n- From Block: {1, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThe possible numbers from 1 to 9 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nThe numbers already present in Row 7, Column 5, and the Block include: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.\n\nThus, the remaining possible number for cell (7, 5) is **2** or **3**. \n\nSince we need only one number, we can deduce that the only number that fits is:\n\n**2**"
