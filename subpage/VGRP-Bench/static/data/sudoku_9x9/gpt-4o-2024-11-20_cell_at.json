Each number from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in every column.\n3. Each number from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in every 3x3 block.\n\n### Steps to Solve for Cell (8, 3):\n- **Row 8:** Look at all the filled cells in row 8 (indexing starts at 0). Row 8 currently contains the numbers: `2, 5`.\n- **Column 3:** Look at all the filled cells in column 3. Column 3 currently contains the numbers: `4, 2, 8`.\n- **3x3 Block:** The cell (8, 3) falls within the bottom-center 3x3 block.
