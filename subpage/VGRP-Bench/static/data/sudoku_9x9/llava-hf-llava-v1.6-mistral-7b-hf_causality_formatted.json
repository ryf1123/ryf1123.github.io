We can deduce that the number 4 must be placed in this position.\n\nIn the fifth row, we already have the number 6, which makes the sum of all numbers used in this row 14. We need another number that's already been placed outside the block to be placed in position 6 (column 4). Since 7 was already used in the first row, 5 is left as the only remaining option.\n\nIn the sixth row, the number 1 is already placed, and we need to find the number that can occupy position 0 (column 1). It must sum with the numbers in this row (5 and 4) to 15. Considering that 2 and 5 are already used in the block, the only remaining option is 8.\n\nLastly, the seventh row is already complete with the numbers 7, 8, 1, and 9. We have no remaining choices, except to refine and confirm the numbers in positions 2 and 6 based on the same row, column, and block constraints. By process of elimination, position 6 must be 4 and 2 must be 6.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:\n\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    [7, 6, 1, 8, 3, 4],\n    [8, 5, 4, 1, 9, 2],\n    [5, 3, 4, 8, 7, 1],\n    [8, 9, 6, 2, 5,",

We should place the number 9 in cells E5 and F3 since 9 is the only number left to place, and it can only fit in those two remaining cells. We need to ensure that all squares in the rows 3, 4 and 5 contain only distinct numbers. For example, the number 3 can be placed in cell C3, and the remaining numbers can be placed in cells D6, E4, F6, A5, A6, A7, B4, C4, C5, C6, C7, D5, D6, D7, E2 and E6.

Since there are already many unique numbers in place, this puzzle is not greatly challenging.\\n\\nFirst, I will work on the small 3x3 subgrids. In the bottom left subgrid, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. We can sort them in ascending order to establish a pattern or sequence for the missing cells. The sequence seems to alternate between negative numbers and positive numbers, as well as taking turns for the same number. For instance, number 1 appears in two consecutive cells, one of them negative. Following this pattern, the missing number should be a positive number that is not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, and is not in the same subgrid. Numbers 10 and 11 occupy the other negative cells in this subgrid, so the missing number is probably 9. Therefore, I will place it in the bottom right corner of this subgrid.\\n\\nNext, I will look at the 3x3 blocks in the rest of the puzzle. Since we already have three distinct numbers in each block that overlap between blocks, we can now look at the remaining cells in each block. There are two subgrids that still need some work. One has the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and the other has 1, 4, 9, and 2. We can apply the same logic as above to determine the missing numbers. The child's puzzle suggestion of \"2\" and \"4\" is consistent with the pattern observed in the other blocks. For the bottom right block, I will place 5, 6, and 8 from the subgrid that has 1, 4, and 9 already in it. We know that 7 is in this subgrid, and it's the largest number not already occupied.

Let's start by examining each of the regions we see here. The region in the top left has only two possible spots for 7, one spot in the middle for 1, and two spots for 6, one in the middle-top and one in the center. Therefore, I can deduce that the empty row with three places for 7 must have 6 in the middle row as it is the only other spot available. The empty column on the far right can only have one of the numbers 3 and 5; let's say it's 5. Then, since that column is right next to the number 3, the only number available for the empty spot in the top row is 4. Similarly, the number 3 can only go in the middle row, and since the number 1 must be in the place where 7 and 5 don't belong (the top left), we can place a 3 in the middle row below the 7. Now we can work on the remaining empty spaces. In the middle region, the column that corresponds to 4 and 6 has only one logical spot for 3. Therefore, that cell must be filled with 8. The next cell that is empty is determined by the fact that the only number remaining in that row that is not yet in a column is 6. So that number can be placed in the center of the grid. The rest of the numbers are placed by a similar process to eliminate all possibilities until the entire grid is complete.\"\n}]\n```",

One of the remaining blocks it could be part of would have 5 as its center, but since 5 is in the center of the current 6x6 cluster, it's not possible in that block, so it must be in one of the two blocks with centers 5 or 6.\n5.

However, let's take a bottom-up approach and start with the easier sections first. In the bottom right quadrant, cells 2, 5, and 9 can already be filled because they have only one possible number in their respective rows and columns. Therefore, those cells can be filled first. Next, there are three cells that are partially filled with two possible numbers. We can eliminate these possibilities using the process of logical deduction. For example, in the first row, the cell in position 2 has two possibilities for 2: either 2 or 6. If we place 2 in position 2 and try to fill the other numbers in the columns [2] and [4], we see that the only possible number for 4 is 8 as the Sudoku rule dictates that the sum of numbers in a column is 15. Thus, we can fill position 4 with 8. Likewise, we can eliminate the other two possibilities for position 2 and fill it with 6. With these two filled positions, we can fill the remaining empty cells in the first row with the help of column and row deductions. Applying the same process to the other cells, we can iteratively fill the other cells based on the Sudoku rule: uniqueness in each row, column, and block. Eventually, I will find the unique solution for the entire 9x9 grid.\",\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"01\": [9, 2, 4, 6, 3, 1, 8, 7, 5],\n    \"02\": [6, 5, 4, 1, 9, 7, 8, 3, 2],",

This is the only number that can fit in the 5x5 block R1C8 to R3C8 (since we already placed 1, 9 and 5 in the row and column directly above - 9, 2 and 5).\n    \n  2. The next row that we can examine is row 4. Here, we have the numbers 6 and 7 already in place. Also, we have 4 in the 1x3 block that starts from R4C10 to R5C10 and 2 in the 4x4 block that starts from R2C8 to R3C8. The block that R4C3 is in does not have 8 yet. It has 9 in it and we crossed out those options due to the list method and the fact that it's in the intersecting 3x3 block with R2C9 and R3C7 and 4 and 8 are already in those cells. Therefore, the number 8 fits the 4x4 subsudoku block in the middle-right of the 4x4 to 5x5 block to the right of R5C1.\n     \n  3. Next, I look at R3C6 where I have already placed the number 3.

For instance, in the top left corner, we have 7 at the top and 1 in the leftmost column. This means that the top row consists of two numbers not connected with any other numbers in that column except the numbers 1 and 7. Let's look at the bottom left column. There are two blank squares in the first two rows, so it is reasonable to assume that the third blank squared of the first column is likely to be filled with 3, since it is already surrounded by 4 and 7. Another noticeable pattern is that the fourth blank square in the second column is sandwiched between two 5s, so it is likely to be filled with a number that we've already placed a 5 somewhere. Let's use 9 for now, given that we need more verified options for that exact column and row.\n\nLooking at our options, we can now start to place more numbers. Let's place 9 is the middle of the first row, since it is surrounded by 1 and 7. In the second row, the number 8, which hasn't been placed yet, is surrounded by 1 and 4, meaning it is likely to go next to one of those numbers, which are at the bottom of the puzzle. However, there is a guiding pattern in the first column for the third blank square, which we can utilize. The third number in the first column is multiplied by 2, and the sum is placed as the second number of the first column. From this logic, we can deduce that the middle number of the first row is also multipled by 2 and incremented. Hence, let's fill the third blank space in the first column with 6.\n\nNow we can fill in more numbers, following similar logic. We can locate the third blank space in the third column by referring to the fact that it needs to be multiplied by 2 and incremented to match the number in the third row. The number 5 surrounded by 1 and 6 is 5N+7, so the third blank space is 16. We also have the number 1 at the end of the second row (not connected with any other numbers), so we should place it at the beginning of the second row's second-to-latest row.\n\nNext, let's look at the top row with the last blank space (8). It is surrounded by 1, 4, 6, and 7. We have already placed 7 and 4, so it must be positioned either above or below one of those numbers. Since it hasn't been placed anywhere else, it must be placed with 7. The last blank space is at the end of the second row, surrounded by 1 and 8; it cannot be 1 or 8 since they have already been placed, so it must be 4.\n\nFollowing the same logic, the last empty space is at the bottom right corner, surrounded by 4 and 7. It is not 4 or 7 for the same reason as the one above it. Let's use 2 for that square, as it fits the logic from the 8x8 Sudoku.",

Since it's the only number already filled in that block, no other numbers can be placed in that block to make that sum. So, 8 must be in the bottom-left cell, making the block 8-1-5-2. The first column can only contain 2 numbers over 6 (since theres 5 numbers over 3 in the second column). There must be two single numbers next to each other in the second row. These doubles are 3 and 4, so 8, 4, and 3 must be in the second row. The third cell is impossible to be 1, 4 or 9, so it must be 2. The number 7 must be the last remaining number in that row. Now it's possible for 3 to occupy the first available position in the first row. This makes the position of the double 3 and 4, and leaves 5 to be the last position of the first column. There are no double possibilities in the first row, so the second cell of the first row is 4. The second row and fourth column is possible under the rule of 3. Now 8, 5 and 2 must be placed. There intersecting cells to look out for. For this reason, 5 cannot be placed at the top-left or bottom-left position of the first column. So, this gives us only one possibility, which is placing 5 in position 1. This means that 4 can be placed at the top-left position of the first column. Lastly, there is no number 7 possible in the remaining space, so it must be 6. Thus, an accurate positioning of 7 leads to no logical solution in this sudoku game.

Here is my thinking process for how I would approach solving this Sudoku puzzle:\n  1. I would start by looking for any clues that can be found in the partially filled squares. For example, I might look for rows or columns that contain only one of each number between 1 and 9. Once I find such a clue, I can fill in that number in the corresponding empty squares.\n  2. I would also look for intersecting clues, such as rows, columns, and the 3x3 blocks. For example, if I find numbers that must belong in the same row or column, I can use this information to narrow down the options in the empty squares.\n  3. If possible, I would also try to complete each three-by-three block, since this gives me more information about the numbers that could go in the empty squares around it.\n  4. As I fill in more squares, I would continue to apply the same reasoning, using the filled-in squares to eliminate numbers in the remaining empty squares, and working my way through the entire grid.\n  5. Once I have enough information, I would solve the puzzle in its entirety, filling in the remaining empty squares with certainty.\n  6. I would keep track of all my findings and decisions throughout the process and make sure to always follow the Sudoku logic, making sure that each row, column, and block has only one of each number between 1 and 9, and that no number is repeated twice in any of these groups.\n  7. Once the puzzle is solved, I would verify that it is indeed a valid Sudoku solution, with unique rows, columns, and block numbers, and no numbers are left out.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    [*\u9000\u56fe* 3, *\u9000\u56fe* 2, 7, *\u9000\u56fe* 8, 1, *\u9000\u56fe* 4, *\u9000\u56fe* *\u9000\u56fe* *\u9000\u56fe* 9,\n    [8, *\u9000\u56fe* 4, *\u9000\u56fe* 9, 7, *\u9000\u56fe* 2, *\u9000\u56fe* 5, *\u9000\u56fe* 8, *\u9000\u56fe* *\u9000\u56fe* 1,\n    [*\u9000\u56fe* 5, *\u9000\u56fe* 4, *\u9000\u56fe* 1, *\u9000\u56fe* 8, *",
