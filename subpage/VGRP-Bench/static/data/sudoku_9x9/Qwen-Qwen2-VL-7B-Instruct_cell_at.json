There are no duplicate numbers except for the number 2, which appears more than once in this block.\n5. **Determine the missing number:** The missing number that can be placed in the cell at (4, 3) must be a number that is not yet present in the row, column, and 3x3 block. Since the numbers 1, 6, 5, 2, and 3 are already present in the row, and the numbers 2, 3, and 4 are already present in the column, the only number left that can be placed in the blank cell is 1.\n\nTherefore, the value of the cell at position (4, 3) is 1."
